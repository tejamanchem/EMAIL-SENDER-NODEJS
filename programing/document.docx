Electronic Mail is a widely used method to transfer/exchange messages among people. We generally send the email with any software or application like Gmail, outlook, thunderbird mail, and yahoo, etc. We can also code the basic concept of these applications in a node.js app by using any third-party library which can interact with the networking systems and send an email.
